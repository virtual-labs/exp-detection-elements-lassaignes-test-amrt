      "question": "What is the role of sodium metal in Lassaigne’s test?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It acts as a reducing agent",
        "b": "It converts covalent compounds to ionic form",
        "c": "It neutralizes acidic impurities",
        "d": "It decomposes water"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Sodium is not primarily acting as a reducing agent in this test.",
        "b": "Correct. Sodium converts covalently bonded non-metals into ionic compounds detectable in solution.",
        "c": "Neutralizing acidic impurities is not the role of sodium in this context.",
        "d": "While sodium reacts with water, its key role is not to decompose it here."

      "question": "The appearance of a blood red coloration during Lassaigne’s test indicates the presence of:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Sulphur only",
        "b": "Nitrogen only",
        "c": "Both nitrogen and sulphur",
        "d": "Chlorine"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Sulphur alone gives a violet colour with nitroprusside, not blood red.",
        "b": "Nitrogen alone gives a blue coloration with FeSO₄ and FeCl₃.",
        "c": "Correct. The red colour comes from formation of [Fe(SCN)]²⁺ due to NaSCN.",
        "d": "Chlorine gives a white precipitate with AgNO₃, not blood red colour."

      "question": "Which of the following is not a step in the preparation of Lassaigne’s extract?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Fusion of compound with metallic sodium",
        "b": "Dipping hot ignition tube in water",
        "c": "Filtering the aqueous mixture",
        "d": "Reacting extract with concentrated H₂SO₄"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is a critical first step.",
        "b": "This helps in extraction of ionic compounds formed.",
        "c": "Filtration is required before testing the extract.",
        "d": "Correct. H₂SO₄ is not used in this procedure."
