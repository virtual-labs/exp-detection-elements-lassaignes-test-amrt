## Theory

It is a general test for the detection of halogens, nitrogen and sulphur in an organic compound. These elements are covalently bonded to the organic compounds. In order to detect them, these have to be converted into their ionic forms. This is done by fusing the organic compound with sodium metal. The ionic compounds formed during the fusion are extracted in aqueous solution and can be detected by simple chemical tests. The extract is called sodium fusion extract or Lassaigne's extract.


<h2>Test for Halogen</h2>
<p>
Halogens present in an organic compound form sodium halide on fusion with sodium metal.
Sodium halide extracted with water can be easily identified by adding silver nitrate solution after acidifying with dilute HNO<sub>3</sub>.

<h3>If chlorine is present:</h3>
<p>A white curdy precipitate <strong>soluble</strong> in ammonium hydroxide solution is formed.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <pre>Na + Cl → NaCl</pre>
  <pre>NaCl + AgNO₃ → AgCl + NaNO₃</pre>
</div>

<h3>If bromine is present:</h3>
<p>A yellowish white precipitate <strong>sparingly soluble</strong> in ammonium hydroxide solution is formed.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <pre>Na + Br → NaBr</pre>
  <pre>NaBr + AgNO₃ → AgBr + NaNO₃</pre>
</div>

<h3>If iodine is present:</h3>
<p>A yellow precipitate <strong>insoluble</strong> in ammonium hydroxide solution is formed.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <pre>Na + I → NaI</pre>
  <pre>NaI + AgNO₃ → AgI + NaNO₃</pre>
</div>

<h2>Test for Nitrogen</h2>
<p>
The carbon and nitrogen present in the organic compound on fusion with sodium metal gives sodium cyanide (NaCN) soluble in water.
This is converted into sodium ferrocyanide by the addition of sufficient quantity of ferrous sulphate.
Ferric ions generated during the process react with ferrocyanide to form prussian blue precipitate of ferric ferrocyanide.
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <pre>Na + C + N → NaCN</pre>
  <pre>6NaCN + FeSO₄ → Na₄[Fe(CN)₆] + Na₂SO₄</pre>
  <p><em>Sodium ferrocyanide</em></p>
  <pre>Na₄[Fe(CN)₆] + Fe³⁺ → Fe₄[Fe(CN)₆]₃</pre>
  <p><em>Ferric ferrocyanide</em></p>
</div>

<hr>

<h2>Test for Sulphur</h2>
<p>
If sulphur is present in the organic compound, sodium fusion will convert it into sodium sulphide.
Sulphide ions are readily identified using sodium nitroprusside.
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <pre>Na + S → Na₂S</pre>
  <pre>Na₂S + Na₂[Fe(CN)₅NO] → Na₄[Fe(CN)₅NOS]</pre>
  <p><em>Violet colour with sodium nitroprusside</em></p>
</div>

<hr>

<h2>Test for Both Nitrogen and Sulphur</h2>
<p>
If both nitrogen and sulphur are present in an organic compound, sodium fusion will convert it into sodium thiocyanate,
which then reacts with Fe³⁺ to form a blood red complex [Fe(SCN)]²⁺.
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <pre>Na + C + N + S → NaSCN</pre>
  <pre>Fe³⁺ + 2Na → [Fe(SCN)]²⁺</pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the Lassaigne's extract contains excess sodium metal, sodium cyanide and sulphides are formed instead of sodium thiocyanate.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <pre>NaSCN + 2Na → NaCN + Na₂S</pre>
</div>

<p>In such cases, both sulphur and nitrogen must be identified with separate tests.</p>
